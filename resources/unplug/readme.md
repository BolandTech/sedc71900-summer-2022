# CS Unplugged
  * Any CS activity that does not involve using a computer.
  * Can involve movement, props, etc. Does not need to.
  * E.g.
    - make a sandwich/paper airplane (craft instructions, follow instructions, debug instructions, etc)
    - "dumb robot" teacher... draw a square on the board | exit the room | etc 
    - sorting dances!
    - sorting & searching with playing cards
    - tear up the phone book!
    - YOUR OTHER GREAT EXAMPLES HERE! (TM will add them per your submissions)
