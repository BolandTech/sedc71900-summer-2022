# CS unplugged
  * Any CS activity that does not involve using a computer.
  * Can involve movement, props, etc. Does not need to.
  * E.g.
    - make a sandwich/paper airplane, draw a square on the board
    - sorting dances!
    - sorting & searching with playing cards
    - tear up the phone book!
