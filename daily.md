# Daily Assignments / Notes

## Day 0 - July 12
  * Class intro
  * What is CS?
  * Why teach CS?
  * What has worked for you as a learner?
  * Difficulties in teaching and learning computer science?
  * Assignment:
    - Have a lesson plan available to share and discuss in class on Wednesday. If you have taught CS, use a CS lesson. If you have not had to create a lesson plan ever, spend time thinking about what a lesson plan would look like.

## Day 1 - July 13
  * Lesson plan review ("talk shop", share protips/techniques)
  * Lesson plan writing
  * Assignment:
    - As a crew, create a lesson plan for a concept covered in the pre-work or the first programming course in this program (not data structures).
    - This should be a lesson plan for your appropriate grade level.
    - You need **not** create supplemental materials like sample code, assignments, etc.
    - Use whatever file format that is more convenient for you, but name the file **`01_lesson`** (with the appropriate file extension) and put it in your **`methods`** folder.
    - For reference, here are the topics
      * Recursion
      * Conditionals
      * Methods
      * Loops
      * Methods/Decomposition/Algorithms
      * Early java
      * Strings
      * Data types / variables

## Portfolio assignment

   Students are to create two detailed lesson plans,
   outlines and supporting materials for computer science. The lesson plans and outlines should include a description of the intended student
   audience and a detailed explanation of how multiple pedagogical techniques can be used in delivering the lesson.

   Each lesson plan should demonstrate different pedogogical techniques, though there may be some overlap.

   For example, if the lesson includes subgoal labeling, the project should include the finished desired code along with the subgoal labels included within.

   The plans can be sequential, or entirely separate.
   The plans must also be aligned to the New York State Standards for Digital Fluency and Computer Science.
   The completed assignment should be such that the portfolio can be given to any computer science teacher and they could deliver the lessons as intended.
